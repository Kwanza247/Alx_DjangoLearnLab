Overview

This document explains the testing strategy, test cases, and guidelines used to verify the functionality, security, and data integrity of the Book API built with Django REST Framework (DRF).

All tests are located in:

/api/test_views.py

Testing Strategy

CRUD Operations

Ensure that books can be created, listed, retrieved, updated, and deleted via API endpoints.

Permissions & Authentication

Verify that only authenticated users can create, update, or delete books.

Confirm that unauthenticated users have read-only access.

Response Data Integrity

Ensure response payloads contain correct fields (id, title, author, publication_year).

Validate correct data is returned after create, update, and delete actions.

Status Codes

Verify correct HTTP response codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 403 Forbidden).
